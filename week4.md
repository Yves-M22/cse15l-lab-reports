Keys Pressed: (up x1)(enter)

- In this step, I simply pressed up once to go through my history on the terminal to log in. The every next command was to log in, and since I already had an ssh key, I was logged in instantly without having to put in my password.
  
## Cloning Fork of the Repository From Github ##

Keys Pressed: (up x19)(enter)

-In this step, I pressed up multiple times to go through my history on the terminal to find the git clone command. I then pressed enter to run the command, which would clone the fork of the repository onto the remote computer.

## Running test.sh to Check Failures ##

Keys Pressed: (c)(d)(space)(l)(a)(b)(7)(c)(o)(p)(y)(3)(enter) (up x3)(enter)

- I don't think I had this command in my history, so I manually entered the command key for key as seen above. The keys pressed shows me switching into the directory of the respository I cloned. Once I was in the directory I wanted, I did have the command for running the script test.sh by pressing the up key and traversing throughy my terminal history. We then reach the output, which shows failures that shouldn't be happening. 

## Editing ListExamples.java in VIM ##

Keys Pressed: (up x 39)(enter) (down x 42)(1)(e)(x)(i)(2)(esc)(w)(q)

- I had issues trying to find this command in my terminal history, but I pressed the up key 39 times to finally find the command to run vim on the ListExamples.java file to edit it and get rid of any bugs. Once I've done this, I pressed down 42 times to reach the line with the bug, then pressed 1e to go the end of the first word in the line. I then deleted the number 1 with the x key, and used the i key to insert 2 instead. I then pressed esc to go into command mode so I can save and exit the file. 

## Rerunning test.sh to Ensure Fix ##

Keys Pressed: (up x 3)(enter)

- I ran the test.sh script from before by pressing the up key a few times to go through my terminal history. Once running it, we can see that the tests now pass as seen in the image above, which means our changes on the file using vim worked properly. 

## Commit and Push to Github ##

Keys Pressed: (up x30)(enter) (up x30)(enter) (g)(i)(t)(space)(p)(u)(s)(h)(space)(o)(r)(i)(g)(i)(n)(space)(m)(a)(i)(n) (followed by putting in personal username and password key) (The two git commands were next to each other, so I was able to easily access them easily, but the push wasn't since I had issues doing that during the lab. The reason I was able to easily get all the commands was from lab)

- I pressed the up key 30 times to run the git add command, followed by press the up key 30 more times to run git commit with a commit message "fixed". Once I did that, I manually enter git push key for key as seen in the keys pressed, to push the changes made on the file onto my account. I then had to log into my account, which is not shown or pictured here, but is what allowed to finally commit these changes.
